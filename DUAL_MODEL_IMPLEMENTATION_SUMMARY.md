# Dual Model Copy Implementation Summary
**Updated Critique: Presenting Free + Paid Tiers Equally**

---

## 🎯 Key Insight

**The landing page needs to present BOTH tiers as equal, valid choices.**

- ✅ **FREE TIER:** Judge 5 → Earn 1 credit → Submit (public)
- ✅ **PAID TIER:** Pay £3 → Submit privately → Instant results

**Current Problem:** Copy treats paid as "skip" or "upgrade," not as equal alternative.

---

## ✅ Updated Critique Principles

### 1. **Equal Weight**
Both paths should have:
- Same visual prominence
- Same button sizes
- Same level of detail
- Same positive framing

### 2. **Situation-Based Choice**
Frame as "which fits your situation?" not "which is better?"

- Free: "Perfect if you have time and want to participate"
- Paid: "Perfect if you're in a hurry or need privacy"

### 3. **Positive Framing**
- ❌ "Skip the line" (negative)
- ❌ "Upgrade to premium" (tiered)
- ✅ "Submit privately" (neutral, positive)
- ✅ "Get instant results" (benefit)

### 4. **Clear Trade-offs**
Show what each path offers:

**Free Path:**
- ✅ No payment
- ✅ Community participation
- ⏱️ Requires time (judging)
- 👁️ Public (in feed)

**Paid Path:**
- ✅ No time required
- ✅ Completely private
- ⚡ Faster responses
- 💰 Costs £3
