# Dual Model Copy Guidelines
**Expert Framework for Presenting Free + Paid Tiers**

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Both paths are valid, intentional choices. Not "free vs premium upgrade."**

The goal is to help users choose based on their situation (time vs money, public vs private), not push them toward one option.

---

## ✅ DO's

### 1. **Present Both Options Equally**
```
✅ "Two ways to get feedback"
✅ Side-by-side comparison
✅ Equal visual weight
✅ Both have clear value props
```

### 2. **Frame as "Which Fits You?" Not "Which is Better?"**
```
✅ "Choose the path that fits your needs"
✅ "Perfect if you [situation]"
✅ "Both get you the same result"
❌ "Upgrade to premium"
❌ "Skip the line"
❌ "Free version"
```

### 3. **Show Clear Trade-offs**
```
FREE PATH:
✅ No payment
✅ Community participation
❌ Requires time (judging)
❌ Public (in feed)

PAID PATH:
✅ No time required
✅ Completely private
✅ Faster responses
❌ Costs £3
```

### 4. **Use Situation-Based Language**
```
"Perfect if you have time and want to participate"
"Perfect if you're in a hurry or need privacy"
"Choose based on your situation"
```

---

## ❌ DON'Ts

### 1. **Don't Frame Paid as "Skip" or "Upgrade"**
```
❌ "Skip the line and go premium"
❌ "Upgrade to private"
❌ "Or skip straight to..."
✅ "Submit privately for £3"
✅ "Get instant private feedback"
```

### 2. **Don't Hide the Paid Option**
```
❌ Only show free path prominently
❌ Make paid option small/secondary
❌ Bury paid option in footer
✅ Show both equally
✅ Let users choose
```

### 3. **Don't Make Assumptions**
```
❌ "Everyone wants free"
❌ "Paid is for premium users"
✅ Present both, let users decide
✅ Some users value time > money
✅ Some users need privacy
```

### 4. **Don't Use Negative Framing**
```
❌ "Skip judging" (implies judging is bad)
❌ "Avoid waiting" (implies free is slow)
✅ "Submit privately" (neutral)
✅ "Get instant results" (positive)
```

### FAQ Format
```
"Do I have to judge others first?"
"Not at all! You have two options: 1) Judge 5 submissions to earn 1 free credit, or 2) Pay £3 to submit privately without judging. Both get you the same feedback quality."

"What's the difference between free and paid?"
"Free path: Judge others to earn credits, then use credits to submit (public). Paid path: Pay £3 to skip judging and submit privately. Choose based on whether you value time or money, and whether you want your submission public or private."
```

## 🎨 Visual Hierarchy

### Equal Weight Principle
Both paths should have:
- Same size buttons/CTAs
- Same visual prominence
- Same level of detail
- Same number of features listed

### Color Coding (Optional)
- Free path: Green/Blue (community, participation)
- Paid path: Purple/Indigo (private, premium)
- NOT: Green = good, Gray = basic

### Typography
- Same font size for both
- Same emphasis level
- Same hierarchy

## 🧠 User Psychology

### Why Users Choose Free
- Want to try before paying
- Have time to participate
- Enjoy community aspect
- Want to see how it works

### Why Users Choose Paid
- Value time over money
- Need privacy/sensitivity
- Urgent decision needed
- Don't want to judge others
- Premium experience expectations

**Both are valid. Present both.**

---

## 📊 Conversion Optimization

### Test Different Framing

**Test 1: Time vs Money**
- "Free with time" vs "Fast with money"

**Test 2: Public vs Private**
- "Community participation" vs "Private confidentiality"

**Test 3: Earn vs Buy**
- "Earn by judging" vs "Buy instantly"

**Test 4: Situation-Based**
- "Perfect if you have time" vs "Perfect if you're in a hurry"

### Track Conversion Rates
- Free path conversion (judge → earn → submit)
- Paid path conversion (pay → submit)
- Which users choose which path
- When users switch paths

---

## ✅ Checklist

Before publishing copy, ask:

- [ ] Are both paths presented equally?
- [ ] Is paid framed positively (not as "skip")?
- [ ] Are trade-offs clear for both?
- [ ] Can users easily compare?
- [ ] Is the choice based on situation, not tier?
- [ ] Are CTAs equal weight?
- [ ] Is the language neutral (not "upgrade")?
- [ ] Do both paths feel like valid choices?

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

**Good Balance =**
- 40-60% choose free path
- 40-60% choose paid path
- Low confusion rate
- High satisfaction with chosen path
- Low path-switching (fewer users changing mind)

**Bad Balance =**
- 90%+ choose one path (skewed)
- High confusion/comparison time
- Low satisfaction ("I didn't know I could...")
- High path-switching

---

**Remember:** The goal is to maximize TOTAL conversions (free + paid), not push users to one option.
