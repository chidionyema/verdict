## 🚨 Critical Communication Issues

### 1. **Cognitive Overload - Too Much at Once**

**Problem:**
- Headline mentions "Review others. Get reviewed." (2 actions)
- Subheadline explains economy model + paid option (2 more concepts)
- Two CTAs with different paths
- Trust indicators scattered
- Use cases rotating

**Impact:** User's brain must process 5+ concepts simultaneously = confusion, decision paralysis

**Fix:** Single, clear value prop first. Details come after commitment.

---

### 2. **Unclear Value Proposition**

**Current Headline:**
```
"Review others. Get reviewed. See how you compare."
```

**Problems:**
- "Review" is ambiguous (evaluate? just look at?)
- Three separate ideas in one sentence
- No clear benefit stated
- Doesn't answer "What's in it for me?"

**Better:**
```
"Get honest feedback from strangers in minutes"
```

**Why Better:**
- ✅ Single, clear benefit
- ✅ Answers "what" immediately
- ✅ "Strangers" = honest (no bias)
- ✅ "Minutes" = fast (urgency)

---

### 3. **Dual Path Confusion**

**Current Subheadline:**
```
"The social network for decisions. Review 5 submissions → Earn 1 credit → Get your feedback, or pay £3 for instant private results. Choose the path that fits you."
```

**Problems:**
- 47 words = too long
- Two complete value props competing
- User doesn't know which to choose
- No clear differentiation

**Better Structure:**
```
Primary message (above fold):
"Get honest feedback in minutes"

Secondary message (below fold, separate section):
"Two ways to get started: Free (review others first) or £3 (instant private)"
```

**Why:** One concept per screen. Don't make users decide between options before they understand the product.

---

### 4. **Jargon and Inconsistent Language**

**Problems Found:**
- "Review" vs "Judge" (inconsistent)
- "Submissions" (jargon)
- "Credits" (requires explanation)
- "Feedback reports" vs "Reviews" vs "Verdicts"

**Fix:** Use plain English consistently:
- ✅ "Feedback" (not verdicts, not reviews)
- ✅ "People" or "Reviewers" (not judges)
- ✅ "Share your question" (not submit)
- ✅ "Get 3 responses" (not reports)

---

### 5. **Weak Headline Hierarchy**

**Current:**
1. Headline: "Review others. Get reviewed."
2. Subheadline: Long explanation of economy
3. Use cases: Rotating examples
4. CTAs: Two buttons

**Problem:** No clear hierarchy. User doesn't know where to look first.

**Better Hierarchy:**
1. **Headline:** Single benefit
2. **Subheadline:** Simple explanation (5-7 words)
3. **Social proof:** Trust signal (single stat)
4. **Single CTA:** One clear action
5. **Then:** Details, features, alternatives

---

### 6. **CTA Confusion**

**Current:** Two CTAs of equal weight:
- "Browse Feed (Free)"
- "Submit Privately (£3)"

**Problem:** 
- Forces decision before understanding value
- 50/50 split reduces conversion
- No clear primary action

**Better:**
1. **Primary CTA:** "Get 3 Free Responses" (hero only)
   - Clear benefit
   - Low commitment (free)
   - Single path forward

2. **Secondary CTA:** "Or pay £3 for instant private" (smaller, below)
   - For those who want to skip
   - Doesn't compete with primary

---

## ✅ Communication Best Practices Applied

### Clarity Principles:
1. **One idea per sentence**
2. **Use concrete language** (not abstract)
3. **Lead with benefits** (not features)
4. **Remove all jargon**
5. **Show, don't explain** (use examples)

### Cognitive Load Reduction:
1. **5-7 word headlines** (max)
2. **One CTA above fold**
3. **Progressive disclosure** (details come later)
4. **Visual hierarchy** (where to look first)

### Conversion Optimization:
1. **Clear value prop first**
2. **Social proof second**
3. **Single clear action**
4. **Objections addressed later**
