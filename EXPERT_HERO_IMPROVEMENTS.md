# ✅ Expert Hero Section Improvements - Implemented

## Changes Made:

### 3. Emotional Hook Added
**New:** "Your friends are too nice. Strangers will tell you the truth."

**Why:**
- ✅ Addresses core pain point
- ✅ Explains why strangers > friends
- ✅ Memorable, shareable

### 4. Single Primary CTA
**Before:** Two equal CTAs (decision paralysis)  
**After:** One primary CTA + small secondary link

**Why:**
- ✅ Eliminates decision paralysis
- ✅ Clear default path
- ✅ Secondary option available but not competing

### 5. Simplified Trust Indicators
**Before:** Multiple cards with multiple stats
