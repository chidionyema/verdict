---

## 🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITIES (Week 1-2)

### 1. **Fix Value Perception: "3 Opinions" → Show Quality Over Quantity**

**Problem:** Users perceive 3 responses as insufficient for $3.99  
**Solution:** Reframe from "3 opinions" to "3 detailed, structured reports"

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create a **"Sample Verdict Card"** component showing exactly what $3.99 gets
- [ ] Show structured feedback format:
  - Rating (1-10) with justification
  - Strengths section
  - Areas for improvement
  - Actionable recommendations
- [ ] Add visual proof: "Before/After" examples with real (anonymized) data
- [ ] Change messaging: "3 comprehensive verdicts" → "3 detailed feedback reports"

**Copy Updates:**
```
Current: "Get 3 expert opinions"
New: "Get 3 structured feedback reports with ratings, strengths, and actionable advice"
```

---

### 2. **Rebrand "Judges" → "Reviewers" or "Advisors"**

**Problem:** "Judge" implies final authority, feels intimidating, raises quality expectations  
**Solution:** Use friendlier, advisory language

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Replace all instances of "judges" with "reviewers" or "advisors"
- [ ] Update messaging: "Verified Judges" → "Vetted Reviewers"
- [ ] Add credibility markers: "Vetted for empathy & constructive feedback"
- [ ] Consider tiered system:
  - **Crowd Reviews** ($1.99): Quick yes/no from general users
  - **Expert Reviews** ($4.99): Detailed feedback from verified professionals

**New Copy:**
```
"Get feedback from vetted reviewers who are verified for empathy and constructive communication"
```

---

### 3. **Implement Tiered Pricing Model**

**Problem:** Flat $3.99 doesn't reflect different use case values  
**Solution:** Category-based or tier-based pricing

**Action Items:**

**Option A: Category-Based Pricing** (Recommended for MVP)
- Dating Profiles: $4.99 (high perceived value)
- Career Decisions: $9.99 (highest perceived value)
- Outfit Checks: $1.99 (lower perceived value)
- General Questions: $3.99 (baseline)

**Option B: Feedback Tier Model**
- **Quick Poll** ($1.99): 10 simple Yes/No votes
- **Standard Review** ($3.99): 3 detailed written responses (current)
- **Expert Review** ($9.99): 3 responses from verified professionals in that field

**Implementation:**
- [ ] Update pricing table to show tiered options
- [ ] A/B test pricing for different categories
- [ ] Add subscription option: "Unlimited Style Checks: $9.99/month"

## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITIES (Week 3-4)

```
"Our reviewers are vetted for empathy, clarity, and constructive communication. 
They must pass a qualification quiz demonstrating they can give honest, 
helpful feedback without being cruel."
```

---

### 5. **Implement "Tone Selection" Feature**

**Problem:** Users need control over feedback harshness  
**Solution:** "Be Gentle" vs. "Destroy Me" toggle

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Add tone selection during request creation:
  - "Be Encouraging" (gentle, supportive)
  - "Be Direct" (honest, straightforward) - default
  - "Be Brutally Honest" (no sugar-coating)
- [ ] Instruct reviewers to match requested tone
- [ ] Surface this as a differentiator: "You control the tone"

---

### 6. **Create Category-Specific Landing Pages**

**Problem:** Generic landing page dilutes value for specific use cases  
**Solution:** Niche landing pages with targeted messaging

**Action Items:**

  - Headline: "Get honest feedback on your dating profile photos"
