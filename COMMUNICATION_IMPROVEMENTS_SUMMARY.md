# ✅ Landing Page Communication Improvements - Summary

## What Changed (Communication Expert Review)

### 🎯 Hero Section Simplification

**Before:**
- Headline: "Review others. Get reviewed. See how you compare." (3 ideas)
- Long subheadline explaining economy model
- Two CTAs of equal weight
- Floating feedback cards (visual noise)
- Rotating use cases
- Multiple trust indicators

**After:**
- Headline: "Get honest feedback from strangers in minutes" (single clear benefit)
- Simple subheadline: "Share your question. Get 3 anonymous responses. Make better decisions."
- Single primary CTA: "Get 3 Free Responses"
- Secondary option as small text link below
- Static use case examples (no animation distraction)
- Single trust indicator line

### 📝 Language Improvements

**Simplified:**
- "Review others. Get reviewed." → "Get honest feedback"
- "Judge 5 submissions" → "Review 5 questions" (in economy section)
- "Feedback reports" → "Responses" (simpler word)
- "Comprehensive feedback reports" → "3 responses"
- "The social network for decisions" → Removed (too abstract)

### 🎨 Visual Hierarchy Improvements

1. **Clearer Headline** - Single benefit, larger font
2. **Reduced Visual Noise** - Removed floating cards, simplified animations
3. **Single Primary CTA** - One clear action instead of two competing options
4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Dual path details moved below fold

### ✅ Communication Principles Applied

2. **Concrete language** (not abstract) ✅
3. **Benefits first** (not features) ✅
4. **Removed jargon** ✅
5. **Reduced cognitive load** ✅

## Next Steps (Below Fold)

The hero is now clearer. Next, we should:
1. Simplify "How It Works" section
2. Clarify dual path explanation (when it appears below)
3. Use consistent terminology throughout all sections
4. Reduce word count in feature descriptions

---

**Impact:** Users now see ONE clear value prop and ONE clear action. No decision paralysis. No confusion. Just: "Get honest feedback" → "Get 3 Free Responses" → Click.
