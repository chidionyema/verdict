## ✅ Consistency Checklist

Before publishing any copy, verify:
- [ ] Using "Reviewers" (not "Judges") for people
- [ ] Using "Feedback" or "Feedback Reports" (not "Verdicts") for output
- [ ] Using "Review" (not "Verdict") for the action
- [ ] Only using "Judge" as a verb in economy context ("Judge others")
- [ ] All CTAs are consistent with terminology
- [ ] No mixing of old/new terminology in same section

**Remember:** First-time users see "judges" and "verdicts" and think "court case" or "legal judgment." Use "reviewers" and "feedback" for clarity.
